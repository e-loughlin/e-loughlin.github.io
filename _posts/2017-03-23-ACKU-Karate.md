I built and continue to manage the ACKU (All Canadian Karate Union) website using WordPress. The website serves over 25 Karate Clubs in western Canada, allowing each instructor to manage their own clubs and schedule events with real-time updates. The site integrates with Google Calendar and Google Maps APIs for seamless event management.

I was a karate instructor with ACKU for 5 years and have been practicing karate with the organization since 2003.

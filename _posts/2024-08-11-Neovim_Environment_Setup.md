# My Neovim Environment

I use Neovim (branched off Astronvim) for my daily development environment. Part of my setup includes:

- Customized key-mappings
- Mason (LSP and Autoformatter integration)
- Debugging Tools
- Telescope (Searching for Words and Files)
- OpenAI Integration

And much more...

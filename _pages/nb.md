This page gathers notebooks I have written on various subjects.  
**Interactive version with [Jupyterlite](https://e-loughlin.github.io/notebooks/lab/) (some modules may not be available)**  

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/e-loughlin/notebooks/tree/main/content) contains the .ipynb files as well as a script to generate HTML pages suitable for Jekyll.
